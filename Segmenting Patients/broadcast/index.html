        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to segment patients based on their symptoms and medical history to assist in triage decision-making.
            Using unsupervised learning, we explore how patients can be grouped based on similarities, which may help in personalized treatment plans.

        <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age, Gender</li>
            <li>Cholesterol Levels</li>
            <li>Blood Pressure</li>
            <li>BMI</li>
            <li>Diabetes History</li>
            <li>Smoking Status</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Clustering Methodologies</h2>
        <div class="method">
            <h3>K-Means Clustering</h3>
            <p>
                K-Means was applied to segment the patients into different risk categories.
                The **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** were used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

        <div class="method">
            <h3>Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)</h3>
            <p>
                GMM was used to identify overlapping patient groups, allowing for soft clustering.
                This helped in understanding how conditions transition between different levels of risk.

        <div class="method">
            <h3>Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
            <p>
                This approach helped visualize patient subgroups in a **dendrogram**, giving insights into risk stratification.

    <section id="insights">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <p>
            After performing clustering, we analyzed the key characteristics of each patient segment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cluster 0: Younger patients, low risk</li>
            <li>Cluster 1: Patients with moderate risk factors</li>
            <li>Cluster 2: High cholesterol and BP, higher risk</li>
            <li>Cluster 3: Severe cases, requiring urgent medical attention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Comparing these clusters with the original triage labels showed that clustering aligns well with real-world risk levels, but some refinements are needed.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusions & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Clustering provides valuable insights for triage, but real-world applications may require hybrid approaches:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using **supervised learning** for improved prediction.</li>
            <li>Applying **dimensionality reduction** to refine clustering results.</li>
            <li>Deploying the model in a real hospital setting for further testing.</li>
        </ul>
